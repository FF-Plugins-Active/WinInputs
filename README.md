PURPOSE:
- This plugin created for "our" startup's internal "desktop" projects !
- So, we will update it with "our needs" and rightnow we have other project priorities.

UPDATES:
- When UE5 finally (not preview ones) out, we are going to update it after figuring out new plugins.

PLATFORM SUPPORT:
- This plugin specifically created for Microsoft Windows. So we don't and won't support other platforms.

CONTRIBUTIONS:
- If you know better approaches feel free to give pull requests. We will appreciate for your contributions.
